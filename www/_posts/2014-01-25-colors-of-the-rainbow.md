Shiny colors of silver and gold,<br/>
Dance across a fancy sheet very bold,<br/>
Splintery browns,<br/>
For wooden crowns,<br/>
Black and gray in the night,<br/>
Nothing much to see when nothings in sight,<br/>
Yellow white so very bright<br/>
With grand tremedous strong might,<br/>
The sea in filled with blue and green,<br/>
Tides that ripple and waves that lean,<br/>
Intense and vivid purple and pink,<br/>
For nice flowers and good brains that think,<br/>
Beautiful grand orange and red,<br/>
for cuts that bleed and fires that spread,<br/>
All colors have different stories, to tell,<br/>
Different sensations and many majestic spells.
